# Battle of Denver Neighborhoods | IBM Data Science Project

Hey, my name is Roman.

This is my first (and therefore BIGGEST) project completed in python to date as part of the IBM Data Science Certificate on Coursera.

This analysis is focused on clustering Denver neighborhoods based on their rent, crime, and venue characteristics. 

Are you still reading? **Nice** (:muscle flex emoji goes here:). 

I utilized BeautifulSoup for webscraping rent data, FourSquare API for downloading relevant venue data, and Pandas package for analyzing it all.

This analysis is not perfect but this is a start in my python learning journey. If you have any feedback, comments, or questions, feel free to reach out to me on <a href='http://linkedin.com/in/romanpk/'>LinkedIn</a> or <a href='https://twitter.com/theromanpk'>Twitter</a>. You can check out my code in the notebook or for a short summary of my methodology and findings check out the PDF deck in this repository. Thanks for reading this far!
