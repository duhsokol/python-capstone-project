# Battle of Denver Neighborhoods | IBM Data Science Project

Hey, my name is Roman. Are you still reading? **Nice** (:muscle flex emoji goes here:). 

This is my first (and therefore BIGGEST) project completed in python to date as part of the IBM Data Science Certificate on Coursera.

This analysis is focused on clustering Denver neighborhoods based on their rent, crime, and venue characteristics. 

I utilized BeautifulSoup for webscraping rent data, FourSquare API for downloading relevant venue data, and Pandas package for analyzing it all.

This analysis is not perfect but this is a start in my python learning journey. If you have any feedback or comments, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn (link in the notebook) or Twitter (link on Github profile). You can check out my code in the notebook or for a short summary of my methodology and findings check out my PDF deck in this repository. Thanks for reading this far!
