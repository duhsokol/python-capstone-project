# Battle of Denver Neighborhoods | IBM Data Science Project

Hey, my name is Roman.

This is my first publisehd project completed in python to date as part of the IBM Data Science Certificate on Coursera. This analysis is focused on clustering Denver neighborhoods based on their rent, crime, and venue characteristics. I hope that it can be a useful tool for someone who is looking to move into this beautiful city and needs a place to start their research and moving process. 

Are you still reading? **Nice** (:muscle flex emoji goes here:). 

This analysis is not perfect but this is a start in my python learning journey. I utilized BeautifulSoup for webscraping rent data, FourSquare API for downloading relevant venue data, and Pandas package for synchronizing and analyzing it all together. If you have any feedback, comments, or questions, feel free to reach out to me on <a href='http://linkedin.com/in/romanpk/'>LinkedIn</a> or on <a href='https://twitter.com/theromanpk'>Twitter</a> (just started my account there). You can check out my code and explore generated maps in the notebook, or, for a short summary of my methodology and findings check out the PDF deck in this repository. Thanks for reading!
